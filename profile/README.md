## Who is Drak? (Introduction)
Hello, my real name is Matt. I just go by Drak online because it is catchy.

I mainly develop software for game servers like Minecraft, but I have professional development experience working as a BI (Business Intelligence) Developer. A BI Dev is a fancy name for someone who develops software based around business intel. This could be warehousing data for analytics, or just simply making an app that fulfills the functions a business wants.

I can work both backend (SQL/NoSQL or specifically server-side code) <u>**and**</u> frontend (making things look nice). I also pick up languages extremely fast (probably because I know so many...), so working with new software stacks is not an issue for me.

## What are you most known for?
I am most known for administrating game servers for large content creators like CheifXD, Target3dGaming, and (more recently) qBedwars / Flxme.

Specifically in the development scene, I'm known for my work with Streamline and BukkitOfUtils. These two server addons make running a server easier and more managable.

## What are you skilled in?
As a BI Dev, I do a lot of the following:
SSH, Git, RESTful APIs, Web Scraping Scripts (when an API is not used), Database Administrating, Setting up Relation Databases with Indexes, using a LOT of Microservices.

My main code stacks:
> - Java
> - Python
> - PHP
> - Javascript

I know and have used:
> - C#
> - Rust
> - Bash/Batch (CMD)
> - Intregations with:
>   - YAML
>   - TOML
>   - JSON
>   - CSS
>   - Markdown
>   - Other Markup or Styling Languages
